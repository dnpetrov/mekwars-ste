+ Repodcommand didn't transfer targetting type or slite status.
+ Added support for "MaxBMSalesTicks" and "MaxBMSalesPrice" in defaults, Sell
  and ServerConfigDialog. Bids can be higher than max asking price. Defaults
  are 100 ticks and 999,999 money.
- Removed MMServ.getProtocolVersion. Was called only from an unused method.
- Removed MMServ.serverStarted(). Was unused.
- Removed MMServ.nameExists(String s). Was unused.
+ Did several ticky-tack TODO's (global announce of faction mutes, etc.)

- Removed SaveCampaignCommand.java Functional dupe of AdminSaveCommand.java.
+ MekWarsAutoUpdate 0.7
+ BUG: issue when creating a manifest on a windows machine and moving it to
  a unix box. IIS is smart enough to convert \ to /, so Unix didn't need to.
+ BUG 1528335: /c modgames not showing compositions if blind drop enabled.
+ BUG: Coloration only matches games when battles tab is sorted by name.
+ BUG: Battles Tab not showing max players.
R Client/Server 0.1.39.0
+ Removed some warnings
+ BUG: AT pilots not always remembering when they fought in a unit. Now units
  remember the pilot ids. AT can ride in multiple units and still repair them
  until someone else takes them into combat.
+ RFE: added MinNumberOfPlayers variable for FFA operations. Default 3
+ Bug removing certain units from their owners in Market2.removeListing().
+ Significant rewrite of Battles tab and host handling. Biggest differences for
  users will be ability to sort (a la BM) and fixes to color scheme (full games
  red, deds yellow when games start, etc). Tested locally and works reasonably
  well, but still has some issues properly tracking who is in a server.
- Removed Calc Battle. Not enough people use it to justify fixing the current
  version. Users are welcome to repair the old code and submit new patch.
- Removed NotifyCommand.java, was a dupe of ServerAnnouncementCommand.
- Removed server side support for "RG" command. Was never sent.
- Removed support for "SOUNDONHOST".

v 0.1.38.x (Closed 7.29.06, No SF Release)
+ BUG: NPE in SPlanet if oldOwner is null.
+ Easier to kick and ban deds.
R Server 0.1.38.2
+ BUG: NPE while processing salvage.
+ BUG: Never ending immunity expiration messages.
R Client 0.1.38.1 / Server 0.1.38.1
+ RFE 1524881: SOL Defection Unit Change. (Works in 3025 era ONLY!)
+ RFE: units left over in the Newbie house bays at startup will get placed back
  on to the market using the vaules for Rare unit sales.
+ BUG: GC while back up occured was causing errors. Back now runs during the
  Tick instead of as a thread launched from the tick.

  they did not sell.
+ BUG 1526629: BM bug
+ BUG 1523255: PPQ bug

+ Added New Ded Command getUpdateURL
R Client/Server 0.1.38.0
+ BUG: Advance repair erroring while trying to report critical hits.

+ BUG: issue with creating manifest file via mwautoupdate format was wrong.
R Client/Server 0.1.37.0 ( For Solaris 7 to test FFA fixes on)
+ New command: /c adminspoof#issuingplayer#commandname#[command options]. Hard
  locked such that only admins can issue. Command level CANNOT be reduced. The
  spoof command allows admins to issue ANY command in a player's stead. Should
  be used exceedingly sparingly, and only when no actual admin command for a
  function exists (ex: to ofrcibly change a user's logo image).
- Removed COMMTABSCOLOR from CConfig.java. Wasn't checked in client code.
+ No more dedicated prefixes. Were silly, as deds only respond to PM's now.
+ Added MM 0.31.9-MW7122006 Has Heatcutoff and /victory /defeat fixes in it.
+ Hosts/Deds now report games instead of players.
+ Stream Lined GO command so that it will now take MM game options without 
  having to hard code in each variable name.

v 0.1.36.x (Closed 07.14.06No SF Release)
+ Replaced config dialog's DEDPREFIX field w/ a DEDAUTORESTART field.
+ Clarified army naming. Specifically, how to REMOVE a name or set no name.
- Removed "Send House Mail" menu option. So far as I can tell, a grand total
  of ZERO people use this. Can be restored if someone actually wants it. :-(
- Removed some old values from CConfig.
- Removed colors Campign menu support.
+ BUG: RegisterCommand did not set save flag for Player file.
- Removed Check for on going operations in UpdateOperationsCommand.java
- Removed common.CampaignData.binHouseBannedAmmoIn, along with common.House's
  HouseBannedAmmoOut and HouseBannedAmmoIn. Dataprovider used instead of bin.
- Removed common.TaskInfo.java. Unused remnant of MMNET's task system.
- Removed common.PlanetEnvironment.equivalent(). Old MMNET code that was both
  unused and useless. Attempted to compare Strings using == instead of .equals,
  so it would have always returned false if it were used.
- Removed unused fromString-style constructor from common.MMClientInfo.
- Removed common.ConfigOptions. Class was totally devoid of content O_o
- Removed common.util.StringConverter. Moved some method into StringUtils.
- Removed common.comm.ChatListener.java/ Was unused. Appears to be a remnant
  of the original dedicated server code, which listened for commands in chat.
+ Replaced some Vectors with ArrayLists in CPersonalPilotQueues, CPlayer, and
  misc. classes that use CPlayer's data. Hangar and Armies retain vectors. Tech
  info and excludes moved into arraylists.
+ Replaced HashTables with TreeMaps in CHSPanel and Map's IconCache. 
+ RFE: Break ImmunityThread out of SPlayer and use one master ImmunityThread
  instead of an individual thread for each immune player.
+ RFE: Show player's market sales in /c mystatus and /c adminplayertstatus.
+ Admins should have access to CheckArmyLink all the time, but everyone else
  should only be able to use it on armies that are already fighting.
- Removed MWChatServer.Constants.java. Unused collection of static ints.
- Removed a constructor from SMWLogger. While it's nice to offer an option to
  use other dirs to store logs, there's no config option support.  :-)
- Removed MWChatServer.broadcastSignOffToUsers(), broadCastSignOnToUsers(),
  getUserCount(), and getUptime(). All unused. Also made PingThread static.
- Removed MMServ.writeToLog(). Remnant of ancient logging system.
- Removed client.dedicated.command.* pacakge. Discrete dedicated commands are
  no not used. See MWClient.parseDedDataInput() for ALL current ded controls.
+ Replace all use of StringBuffers with StringBuilers, which are new in Java5.
  Builders aren't synchronized and should be faster. Safe b/c we don't ever
  generate Strings using input from multiple threads simultaneously.
- Removed vestigal NewsChannel code from CCommPanel. MMNET hold over.
- Removed UF-style (curr BV, ratio, etc) info from MechDetailDisplay.
+ Finalized MWClient statics. Removed option to set gui command prefix.
- Removed CCommPanel.changeStatus(). Was used in waaay ancient MMNET times to
  block access to house chat while logged out. This is no longer needed.
- Removed CPlayer.addUnit(). Was unused. New units added using PL|HD. This is
  non-intuitive. See CPlayer.setHangarData() and SPlayer.addUnit() comments.
- Removed CPlayer.addArmy() and various support methods it called. Superceded
  by PL|SAD and CPlayer.setArmyData().
- Removed all support for client side ./campaign.player.dat file. Completely
  superfluous and unused b/c of server side autologin. Deleted LoginGCCmd and
  CPlayer's saveData(), loadData(), getHangarString(), getPlayerString() and
  clearData() methods. 
- Removed CCampaign.clearData(), loadHouseData(), loadPlanetData()
+ Renamed Unit.getModelname() to checkModelName() and switched all all server
  side uses of the Unit method to SUnit's getModelName(), which is better.
+ Added generics to PilotQueue Vectors and LinkedLists.
+ Factored PilotQueues.listDispossessedPilot code into AdminHousePilots.
+ Reworked BuildTable.java. No more static constructor or self-refential
  static accesses. All hashtables, etc. now contained w/i individual methods.
+ Use disputed color in SPlanet descriptions instead of black, where possible.
+ Changed several classes to explicitly close file input and streams after
  reading or writing files. Will do this in other classes as noticed.
+ Changed several classed to use StingBuffer or StringBuilder in lieu of looped
  String concatenation. Will do this in other places as noticed.
+ Make CampaignMain a final class. Subclassing would result in errors b/c
  the super() constructor would start threads before subclass construction.
+ Check for null and empty lines in CampaignMain.loadFactionData().
- Removed MMServ.cleanup() and .removeBadChars(). Were unused.
- Removed CampaignMain.getCurrentTick() Unused.
- Removed SHouse.potentialHouseProduction(). Unused. MMNET remnant.
+ BUG: Still possible to kick admins. Oops.
+ BUG: NPE in ShortResolver. Attempting to get HS|RU string for null unit. 
+ BUG: HS| updates not being sent when faction takes complete control of
  previously contested world.
- Removed old planet code that described relative position ("Near the border
  and subject to frequent raiding from YYY"). Bloat, as nearly all people use
  the visible map instead of /c planet to get target hints.
+ Use regexp \s+ to find and replace all multi-spaces with single spaces when
  loading build tables. This lets ops format things more legibly.
R Client 0.1.36.1 / Server 0.1.36.1
+ Move production logs from mainlog to infolog.
+ Add modmail to modlog in ModeratorMailCommand instead of CampaignMain's
  .doSendModMail(). Most commands add directly to the modlog, making logs
  of non-user-chat modmail duplicative.
+ Exclude various mail and messaging commands from cmdlog.0.
+ Removed debug output in ExclusionList
+ Added MM 0.31.9-MW6292006
+ Added Victory Conditions Code from MM to Operations an Operations Editor.
R Client/Server 0.1.36.0
+ BUG 1474353: ejected and picked up mechwarrior does not survive
+ BUG 1483315: Failed autoreports

v 0.1.35.x(Closed 6.27.06. No SF Release)
R Client 0.1.35.2 / Server 0.1.35.3
+ BUG 1511467: Astech not working when using standard repairs.
+ BUG: NPE's possible in /me, /mm, /hm and /incharacter if sent with no text.
+ "Faction Colors" in lieu of "House Colors" in config dialog for consistancy.
+ RFE: make it impossible to kick or ban admins.
+ BUG: should do disconnect check BEFORE logging out kicked/banned players.
R Server 0.1.35.2
+ BUG: /me broken, sent emotes only to player who issued command.
+ RFE: Remove activity counts from /c players if status is hidden. Continue
  printing all info for own faction and for server admins. Showing the counts
  was an old practice that doesn't make much sense on current servers.
+ BUG: Sending winner HS updates to losing house in some situations. oops :-(
+ Added FileChooser instead of FileDialog to MWAutoupdater. This was only the
  a folder has to be selected instead of a file.
+ Added a new method to AorAn. Renamed class to StringUtils.
+ Lots of small string changes. Far fewer "has been" and "have been"'s now.
+ Possible fix for "Cancellation Ghosts." Don't return players to active status
  if they have disco threads that don't have playerReturned == true.
R Client/Server 0.1.35.1
+ Added MM 0.31.9-MW6152006
+ Change timestamp for server side data to only be updated in Store() command.
+ Added example for creating mountains in terrain.xml
+ Added code to for mountain generation with MM RMG
+ BUG: units added via SHouse.tick() and Market2.tick() where sent to the
  players before the tickThread sent CC|NT|. Now all min sales are incremented
  by 1 to offset this issue.
+ BUG: Login CC|NT| decremented BM sales ticks.
+ BUG: Sold units where being removed directly from the Auction TreeMap causing
  a concurrent modification error. 
+ BUG: ShortResolver.selectRandomLoser() would select winners.firstKey() if
  only 1 loser existed. Cut&Paste God strikes again!
+ BUG: mmconf folder not created when pulling gameoptions.xml from the server
  this is use by both MM and MW. MM will create it once a game is launched;
  however, it is needed much sooner.
+ BUG: ConcurrentMod Error in market2.tick()
+ BUG: Timestamp client side was getting set before the PDiff command was being
  sent. This caused planet updates to never happen.
R Client/Server 0.1.35.0
+ BUG: SPlanet.sendHouseStatusUpdate() did not take into account planets with
  no clear owners.
+ Made some additional SUnit methods static (getHangarSpaceRequired,
  getMapSizeModification) static. Moved getRandomPilotName to SPilot.
- Removed server.comm.*  and moved commands into MWChatServer.commands.*
+ Less redundant code in Market2.tick, removeListing, and removeAllListings. 
+ BUG: Removing units from SHouse, instead of sending a removal command to the
  clients, when adding faction unit to BM.
- Removed UPDATEMESSAGE from serverconfig. Mooted by MekWarsAutoUpdater.
- Removed HelpCommand.java and updated default severconfig.txt
+ Don't send PMs, HM's, MM's, and RP messages that are only spaces.
- Turned off debugging messages client side for inflation.
+ Server now sends both compressed data size and uncompressed data size in the
  /deflate command. This allows the client to create a byte array big enough to
  hold all of the server data, This should prevent the issue that TT caused
  with its massive data! This also causes a break in the communications
  protocol and requires a new REV.

v 0.1.34.x (Closed 6.12.06. No SF Release)
R Server 0.1.34.2
+ Changed the byte array length for _deflation to that of the length of the
  string s instead of guessing with static variables.
+ BUG: Units put on the market by factions, or as rares, were not updating
  clients propelry on removal.
+ BUG: Market2.addListing(String, SUnit, int, int) did not check to see if 
  unit was being added by a faction, caused annoying error messages.
+ Added new MegaMek.jar file 0.31.9-MW6122006
+ R Client 0.1.34.1 / Server 0.1.34.1
+ Max byte array increased to 29999 from 9999. TT's facton data was so long
  that it exceeded the array length. Who knew?
R Client 0.1.34.0 / Server 0.1.34.0
+ Improved [Use RP] link placement and clarified of post-game RP messages.
+ Include clickable defection link in game result if newbie player has enough
  XP to join a standard faction.
+ Show multiplayer grouping in /c check output.
+ Improved Enroll/Register procedure. Players must have campaign accounts to
  register nicknames, enrolling players are saved immediately, and userlevels
  are updated more reliably.
- Reverted change saving serverconfig.txt after using SetSMOTDCommand. Saves
  stripped out comment lines, and overwrote some other values (SERVERPORT) with
  defaults. Best practice is for ops to hand edit the file and confirm changes.
+ Some tweaks to AdminLockFactory and RefreshFactory, so they refresh HS.
+ HouseStatus tab now receives automatic, incremental updates from server. This
  required signficant rewrites of portions of CHSPanel, SHouse, and HS.java, as
  well as numerous conforming changes throughout the rest of the codebase. The
  entire status is sent during doLogin(). Small changes (donation, scraps) are
  sent to the client immediately. Large changes (ticks) use StringBuffers to
  queue commands and send a single change string, which can be compressed.
+ RFE: Penalize failed transfers same as a deliberate scrap.
- Removed GrantControlCommand. Was dupe of AdminExchangePlanetOwnershipCommand.
- Removed SUnitFactory.tick(). Easier to just use addRefresh directly.
- Removed SUnitFactory.getConfig(). Was an evil hack, and can use static cm.
- Removed SHouse.listDispossessedPilots(). Was unused.
- Removed SHouse.cleanUpHangarAndPP(), contents into SHouse.tick(). This makes
  sending HS| updates to players on ticks much simpler.
- Removed SHouse.recalcWarehouseAndComponents(). Was unused. Functionality had
  been moved into SHouse.addPlanet() and SHouse.removePlanet().
- Removed SHouse.setPP(). Was unused.
+ BUG: Pilots not healing while players off-line.
- Removed server.campaign.comm.* package. HouseStatus and PlayerStatus commands
  in the pacakge were unused, but still being loaded by MWServer.java. The 1st
  was replaced by server.campaign.commands.StatusCommand.java. PlayerStatus is
  now handled using SPlayer.toString() with PS| prepended (see CampaignMain's
  doLoginPlayer method). These have been sitting unused for years O_o
+ Autoupdating BM. No more refreshing! Yay!
+ Added check in RepairTrackingThread to see if unit is still reparing before
  saying the unit is fully operational.
- Removed 1ms sleep in deflateAndSend() it was a debugging tool.
- Removed excess printing to the warn log and streamlined the /deflate message
- Removed a few unused variables and methods from ConnectionHandler,
  MWChatServer, MWChatClient and AbstractConnectionHandler.
+ BUG: AutoResolve Disconencts not refreshing armie BV's
+ Added a 9000 character autoflush in the flushDeflate method
+ Added method ConnectionHandler.deflateAndSend(String);
+ 7000 charachter cap on faction MOTD's.
+ Increased ded reconnection time to 90 seconds, from 60.

0 Compression warrants a version change. Flipping to 0.1.34.x
+ Added code to allow for compression of messages with 200+ bytes in size.

v 0.1.33.x (Closed 6.7.06. No SF Release)

  where I clicked it

+ Added ForceUpdateKey.java
+ Added ForceUpdateCommand.java
+ Mod House status to not display piloting/gunnery skills of 99/99
+ Attacking faction name name included in chicken/leech messages.
+ Post game results to faction channel, as is already done with new games.
- Removed AddNewsCommand. Unused, but potentially damaging to outside parsers.

v 0.1.32.x(Closed 6.4.06. No SF release)
R Client 0.1.32.1 / Server 0.1.32.5
+ Deds who lose connection try to rejoin every 60 seconds instead of every 10.
+ Don't trigger name or keyword pings from RP Channel if completely disabled.
+ BUG: Reparing empty slots caused errors.
+ BUG: Actuators where being treated like Mounted in AR code.
+ BUG: Market2.getAutoMarketStatus(SPlayer) lost | when when BV was removed
  from the datastream.
+ Added CampaignMain.forceSavePlayer(SPlayer) method to save new PFiles when 
  player defects or has their name changed.

+ Removed references to "House" from forceddefect.
R Server 0.1.32.4
0 Moved history entries though 0.1.9.X to olderhistory.txt
+ Do not delete PFile when using Defect or ForcedDefect commands. Continue
  deleting from ChangeName, DeleteAccount and Unenroll commands. This change
  ensures that player data will not be lost during a crash (unless the pfile
  hasn't ever been saved), but may lead to some unit duplication.
R Server 0.1.32.3
+ added back flushSimple() from 32.1
+ removed bad socket test code.
R Server 0.1.32.2
- removed new flushSimple() reverted back to old one.
R Server 0.1.32.1
+ added extra flusing to Dispatcher now flushes every 5k of data.
R Client 0.1.32.0 / Server 0.1.32.0

+ New user registration dialog. Confirms passwords and wants about plaintext.
+ Admins who re-register their passwords retain admin status.

+ BUG: City Builder options not being sent to fighting players who disco and
  reconnect. This allowed people to "inexplicably" clear cities from maps.
+ BUG: BuildingOptions not being sent to fighting players during reconnection.
  This created problems with ops that had building targets, but no buildings.
+ BUG: Starting position not sent to fighting players during reconnection. Note
  that this fix will NOT work for free for all games, which don't save spots
  assigned to the participating players. Only way to fix a FFA is to restart.

+ Added GUI to admin.jar for new Pilot Damage changes.
+ Pilot will now heal while player is off line, if they are off line long
  enough to be remove from the queue and have to be loaded via a PFile

  server. Had the socket flush itself.
+ Changed Admin Map Commands to refresh instead of reloading all data.
+ RFE: Attempt to load units via unit.cache before reading from zips in
  TableViewerDialog. This seems to work well for MTF, HMP and HMV units,

+ BUG: Invisible players shown in /c players.
+ Show pilot/crew/squad, as appropriate for unit type, when assigning a new
  pilot to a salvaged or recovered unit in ShortResolver.handleDeadPilot().
